Not sure if online GDB would support external libs for Unit tests so a unit test function was developed,

Code from last question was copied so no header file would be needed.

## 5

[Answer](https://github.com/LC-Duarte/SiemensQuiz/blob/main/5.sql)


Last sentence is confusing.

"If there are more than one student with the __same grade__ (1-7) assigned to them, sort those students in particular by their __grades__ in ascending order".

Asumed:

"If there are more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, sort those students in particular by their __value__ in ascending order".

Sample Output coflicts with requirement.

    "If there are more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, sort those students in particular by their names in alphabetical order".

and sample output shows:

    Marcela 9 88

    Julia 9 81

Assumed sample output was wrong. If this assumption is incorect replace 'name ASC' for 'name DESC'
